Budget Management App

PHP project with MySQL and Apache. Developing this web app I learned a lot about PHP, PWA, how to use MySQL and developing a fullstack web app.
One of the most important skill I learned from this was encrypting data and credentials and prevent different kind of attacks by e.g. sanitizing user input. After this project I've advanced forward to better project management using abstraction, component based structure and more practical source tree structure.
